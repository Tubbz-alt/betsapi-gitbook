# Events API Summary

## Introduction

Events API is aggregated from Bet365 (main source) and others. It keeps history data (since Sep 2016).

We splitted it into Soccer API, Basketball API, Tennis API and others in case people are just interested in one sport.

It includes Fixtures, Inplay and Results.

### Difference with other APIs

It only include 1-3 main markets for each sports. If you need all odds markets, you should use Bet365/Bwin/Betfair API instead.
